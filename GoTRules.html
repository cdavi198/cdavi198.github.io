                <li>Some teams may have some of the same characters depending on how people want to spend their budget</li>
                <li>There will be no dropping of characters throughout the season, so you’ll never receive any bid money back in order to pick up other characters mid-season.</li>
                <li>There is no trading available, once your team is picked it’s set.</li>
                <li>Make sure to check the Scoring page before selecting your characters.</li>
                <li>If one of your characters is killed, you won't be able to replace that character.</li>
