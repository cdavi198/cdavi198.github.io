            <p>Players will start with a $100 budget.</p>
            <p>Each draftable character will have a monetary value attached, as shown on the Characters page.</p>
            <p>You can draft as many players as your budget allows.</li>
            <p>Some teams may have some of the same characters depending on how people want to spend their budget</p>
            <p>There will be no dropping of characters throughout the season, so you’ll never receive any bid money back in order to pick up other characters mid-season.</p>
            <p>There is no trading available, once your team is picked it’s set.</p>
            <p>Make sure to check the Scoring page before selecting your characters.</p>
            <p>If one of your characters is killed, you won't be able to replace that character.</p>
